A periodically and inconsistently updated list of various different coffee drinks I've tried, mostly with an emphasis on trying different syrup flavors for fun.

### Cold brew
**Stok Bold and Smooth, Polsky Exchange, 6/21/24**
Truly wonderful! My coworker bought it for us, as we're a part of the Polsky Exchange's BUILD Accelerator to work on our startup idea, InsightEd. One of the startups has lots of coffee and creamer in the shared fridge, and it seemed like a great idea, so we got some to share (no stealing here). Hmm, maybe having some cold brew in my fridge during the school year wouldn't be *that* bad of an idea... 10/10

### Almond
**Grounds of Being, cafe au lait, 3/1/24**

A pre-finals week treat! Not my favorite though; I'm not a big fan of almonds, so I'm not sure it tasted like almonds, and more just tasted sweet. The almond-ish flavor seemed like it amplified the acidity a little bit, which isn't to my personal taste when I get coffee, so I won't be trying it again. 4/10

### Blackberry
**Harper Cafe, cafe au lait, 2/26/24**

Haven't been to Harper Cafe in quite a while! Definitely my favorite cafe on campus but it gets busy very quickly. Found the blackberry syrup to be kind of a lot and quite concentrated at the start. (Probably on me, I need to stir my drinks better.) I think it could be better with a darker roast for overall darker flavor. The blueberry's not super harmonious with the coffee and milk flavor though, it's kind of one or the other so one ends up dominating over the other. 6.5/10 

### Vietnamese coffee (library)
**Regenstein Library basement, 2/22/24**

Surprisingly good! I've had it before but am only just now writing about it since one of my friends mentioned that I should. I got it from a milk tea vending machine in the library basement, where the drinks usually have a somewhat plasticky taste. Thankfully this didn't! Not too rich, especially considering that Vietnamese coffee usually is in my experience, but nothing too special overall. There's a coffee shop on campus with a much better one, so next time I go there I'll have to compare it. Good for caffeine in a pinch, but nothing crazy. 5.5/10

### Toffee nut
**Ex Libris, cold brew, 2/20/24**

Espresso machine was broken so my plans of a cafe au lait were sadly dashed. It's warm outside though so a cold brew is nice and refreshing! Tried the toffee nut syrup since it's seasonal and we're nearing the end of the season. Doesn't taste too different to hazelnut, and I think I would have preferred it with some steamed milk, as the acidity of the cold brew doesn't really do it any favors. I'll probably stick to hazelnut in the future, or just get it in more milk-heavy drinks. 6/10

### Nitro Cold Brew
**Starbucks can (with a hint of sweet cream) from Cafe Logan, 2/9/24**

Pretty good considering I didn't drink it the intended way! Smooth and sweet cream cuts the acidity. A little pricey for such a small drink though. Shout out for getting me through a 12-hour day of mixing a musical (Falsettos) though, extra point for that. 7/10

### Mocha
**Ex Libris, mocha, 1/24/24**

Beautiful, usually reserved for weekends but needed a little sugar boost before lab. Nice to save as a special treat, a little too much for me to have a lot, but delicious! Be careful to avoid the residual mocha sauce in the bottom of the cup though, I've accidentally drunk it before and it just tastes like chocolate goop. Shout out to the Ex Libris baristas, they always do mocha art on top and it makes my day! 8/10, 100/10 looks

### Brown sugar

**Ex Libris, latte, 1/12/24**

pretty good! nice sweetness so that it's not overwhelming, and the spice brings a nice warmth of flavor to the drink. Great winter drink, especially since I walked to Promontory Point at 7am today and there's a winter storm outside, I feel very whimsical. 7/10


### Strawberry

**Grounds of Being, drip coffee 1/5/24**

not bad, nice and fruity (obviously). Goes well with the dark roast and I shouldn't have added milk. For coffee though I think I prefer less fruity tastes. 6/10


### Salted caramel

**Ex Libris, cafe au lait 1/4/24**

Not mixed very well, so no flavor at the beginning of the drink and too much at the end. Avoided the sticky sweet taste that caramel sometimes has to me though, so would try again in a different drink. 6.5/10
