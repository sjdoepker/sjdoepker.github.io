**Salted Caramel**
- Ex Libris, Cafe au lait 1/4/24
Not mixed very well, so no flavor at the beginning of the drink and too much at the end. Avoided the sticky sweet taste that caramel sometimes has to me though, so would try again in a different drink. 6.5/10

**Strawberry**
- Grounds of Being, drip coffee 1/5/24
not bad, nice and fruity (obviously). Goes well with the dark roast and I shouldn't have added milk. For coffee though I think I prefer less fruity tastes. 6/10

**Brown sugar**
- Ex Libris, latte 1/12/24
pretty good! nice sweetness so that it's not overwhelming, and the spice brings a nice warmth of flavor to the drink. Great winter drink, especially since I walked to Promontory Point at 7am today and there's a winter storm outside, I feel very whimsical.

**Mocha**
- Ex Libris, mocha 1/24/24
Beautiful, usually reserved for weekends but needed a little sugar boost before lab. Nice to save a s a special treat, a little too much for me to have a lot, but delicious! B ecareful to avoid the residual mocha sauce in the bottom of the cup though, I've accidentally drunk it before and it just tastes like chocolate goop. Shout out to the Ex Libris baristas, they always do mocha art on top and it makes my day! 8/10, 100/10 looks
