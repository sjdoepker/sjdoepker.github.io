# Scaredy Cat, Ex Libris, 10/31/2024 

*Chamomile tea steeped in coffee with cold foam* 

And we're back! (finally) With summer ending and the quarter starting, writing little coffee reviews has sort of fallen to the bottom of the priority list. But Ex Libris had a new seasonal drink that I was too curious about to not try (and I got marketed to because there was a cute little cat drawing on the). The Scaredy Cat is a bag of chamomile steeped in coffee with cold foam, which definitely sounds a little confusing. The drink is hot, so the cold foam melts (dissolves?) away in just a few minutes. I have to say, I think I've discovered I'm not a big fan of cold foam-at least, not in a hot drink-and it was so sweet that I couldn't really taste anything else until it dissolved. The actual coffee-chamomile blend isn't bad, and largely just tastes like a light and more herbal version of coffee. I would recommend trying this (maybe without the cold foam), it's a unique and very seasonally appropriate drink! Happy Halloween! 6.5/10
